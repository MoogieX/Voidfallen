Download the game.exe file

This is NOT malware, check the code yourself if you are worried. In the later stages of the game it DOES acsess the system directory username, whatever that may be on your laptop
Though it will be real awkward if your username is something about dicks lol but here is how it will work
('munki' from 'C:\Users\munki') <------- I have made sure it does not read any files and only uses the below command:
 os.path.expanduser('~')
 Take of that what you will, it is alright if that makes you uncomfortable. There will be another version of the game without any of the darkmode and system fuckery(even though it isn't really)
