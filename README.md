# Voidfallen

This is a text-based adventure game. You can play it in your browser or by running the Python script.

## Web Version

To play the web version, open `docs/index.html` in your browser.

## Python Version

To play the Python version, run the `game.py` script from your terminal:

```
python game.py
```

### Executable

There is also a `.exe` file in the `dist` directory that you can run to play the game.

**Note:** The Python version of the game accesses your system's username to personalize the experience. It does this by using the `os.path.expanduser('~')` command and does not read any other files. If you are uncomfortable with this, you can play the web version, which does not have this feature.
