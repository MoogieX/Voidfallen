# Voidfallen: Ultimate Path & Bug/Exploit Review

## Main Paths and Features Tested

### 1. New Game (Intro/Skip)
- **Intro path:** All dialog, name, and backstory prompts work. Developer mode triggers for "moogie".
- **Skip intro:** Name prompt works, developer mode triggers, game starts as expected.

### 2. Difficulty Selection
- **Options menu:** Difficulty can be set before starting a new game. Enemy scaling changes as expected for easy/normal/hard.

### 3. Exploration
- **All directions:** North, West, East, Village, Ruins, Cavern, Craft, Back.
- **Village:** Shop, rest, crafting, and leave all work.
- **Cavern:** Lantern/fuel checks, navigation, debuffs, and escape/lost logic all function.

### 4. Battles
- **Enemy pools:** Correct for act, cavern, and rare spawns.
- **Debuffs:** Poison and bleed apply and tick correctly. Bandages cure both.
- **Lifesteal:** Only triggers if enemy is alive after attack.
- **Run:** 50% chance to escape works.

### 5. Items & Crafting
- **Shop:** All items purchasable, gold deducted, inventory updates.
- **Crafting:** Bandages from silk in all locations (explore, after battle, village, dev).
- **Lantern:** Auto-fueled on first acquire, refuel works, fuel decrements per move.

### 6. Save/Load/Export
- **Save/load:** Works at all points, including after death in cavern.
- **Export:** Player data exports to JSON.

### 7. Developer Mode
- **All commands:** Give, gold, heal, equip, goto, stats, craft bandage, exitâ€”all work as intended.

## Exploit & Game-Breaking Bug Review

### Exploits

- **Bandage Crafting:** Unlimited crafting is possible if the player has enough silk, but this is intended.
- **Shop:** No gold exploit; gold is checked before purchase.
- **Lantern Fuel:** No infinite fuel exploit; refueling requires animal fat.
- **EXP/Level:** No infinite EXP exploit; only awarded for battle wins.
- **Run from Battle:** 50% chance, no infinite escape.

### Game-Breaking Bugs

- **Cavern Escape:** If lantern fuel runs out and the player is not at the entrance, they are reset to last save. No infinite loop or softlock.
- **Difficulty:** Difficulty is session-based and not saved/loaded, but this is by design.
- **Inventory:** No negative inventory possible; all item removals are checked.
- **Battle:** No crash on death; game exits cleanly.
- **Crafting:** No crash if crafting without enough materials; proper message shown.
- **Shop:** No crash if buying without enough gold; proper message shown.
- **Save/Load:** No crash on missing save file; proper message shown.

### Minor/Edge Cases

- **Multiple Lanterns:** If player acquires multiple lanterns, only the first triggers auto-fuel. This is not exploitable.
- **Developer Mode:** Can be used to give unlimited items, but this is intentional for testing.

---

## Conclusion

**No game-breaking bugs or major exploits found.**  
All main and edge paths function as intended.  
Game is robust for all tested scenarios.

## Troubleshooting: PyInstaller Not Recognized

If you see:
```
pyinstaller : The term 'pyinstaller' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.
```

### Solution

1. **Make sure PyInstaller is installed:**
   ```
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **If using PowerShell or CMD, try:**
   ```
   python -m PyInstaller --onefile game.py
   ```
   or
   ```
   py -m PyInstaller --onefile game.py
   ```

3. **If still not recognized:**
   - Close and reopen your terminal after installing.
   - Make sure your Python/Scripts directory is in your PATH environment variable.
   - You can check if PyInstaller is installed by running:
     ```
     pip show pyinstaller
     ```

4. **If using a virtual environment:**
   - Activate your virtual environment first, then run the command.

---

**Summary:**  
Use `python -m PyInstaller --onefile game.py` if `pyinstaller` is not recognized.

## FAQ

### If I update the code, will that also update the .exe?

**No.**  
If you change your Python code (`game.py`), you must re-run the PyInstaller command to generate a new `.exe` file.  
The `.exe` is a snapshot of your code at the time you built it.  
To update the `.exe`:

1. Edit and save your changes to `game.py`.
2. Re-run:
   ```
   python -m PyInstaller --onefile game.py
   ```
3. Use the new `.exe` in the `dist` folder.
